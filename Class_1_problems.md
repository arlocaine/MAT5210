## Problems

### 1.1
A soccer ball is made up of pentagons and hexagons with 3 faces meeting at each vertex. Prove that the number of pentagons must be 12 in such a polygonal pattern making a sphere.

### 1.2
Consider 8 cubes glued face-to-face in a 3x3 grid with a hole in the middle as shown. Inflating the shape gives a polygonal pattern $\pi$ on a torus.
  a) Show that $\chi(\pi)=0$.
  b) Assume that $\chi(\pi)=0$ for all polygonal patterns on a torus. Prove that only three such patterns consist of $n$-gons ($n\ge 3$) with $m$ faces meeting at each vertex ($m\ge 3$) are possible.
